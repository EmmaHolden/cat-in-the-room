## How to Play 
This is a simple browser-based web game based on the game 'Marco Polo'.  
The user uses their mouse to click and find an invisible cat within a limited number of clicks.  
When the user clicks, the cat meows in response and the volume gives the user clues on how close they are (with louder indicating closer).  
Alternatively, users can press spacebar to activate silent mode and instead a gauge appears in the top left corner to signal how 'hot' or 'cold' the user's last guess was.   
There are three difficulty levels, with increasing difficulty reducing the number of clicks the user is allowed before the game ends.   
The game ends either when the cat is found or the user runs out of clicks.   

## How to Run
Simply clone the repository and you can open the website locally. All images and sounds are included locally and no additional setup is required. 

## Developing Cat In The Room
Cat in the Room was created initially as a personal CSS-based challenge to become more knowledgeable about CSS absolute and relative positioning as well as animations.
Users can interact with the furniture while playing the game - the lamp swings, the computer glitches, the rug is lifted up and the items on the bookshelf shake. 
During development of this game, I found several uses for JQuery and have familiarised myself with its uses.
